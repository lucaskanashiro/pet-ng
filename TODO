Those features are supported by the actual PET version for each Debian team:

- Separate packages in sections:
  * Ready For Upload
  * Packages with RC bugs
  * Missing tags
  * Newer upstream version
  * Problems with debian/watch
  * New packages
  * With bugs
  * Work in progress

- A package entry contains:
  * Package: package's name
  * Repository: package's version in Debian git repository (the latest tag and
    in parenthesis the version in debian/changelog on the top commit)
  * Archive: package's version in Debian archive
  * Bugs: number og package's bugs
  * Upstream: the latest upstream version

We also need to provide an easy way to register new teams
